# File ID Configuration for Auto-Generation
#
# This file defines the module ranges for automatic file ID assignment.
# Each module gets a dedicated range of IDs to avoid conflicts.
#
# Format:
#   module_name:
#     start: <first ID in range>
#     end: <last ID in range>
#     description: <human-readable description>
#
# Rules:
#   - IDs must be in range 1-4095 (12-bit limit in log encoding)
#   - Ranges must not overlap
#   - Leave gaps between modules for future expansion
#   - Never reuse IDs from deleted modules (mark as 'reserved' instead)

module_ranges:
  # System initialization and boot code (1-50)
  brom:
    start: 1
    end: 50
    description: "BROM initialization and startup code"

  # Hardware driver layer (51-150)
  drivers:
    start: 51
    end: 150
    description: "Hardware drivers (UART, SPI, I2C, etc.)"

  # Application layer (151-250)
  app:
    start: 151
    end: 250
    description: "Application logic and business code"

  # Test code (251-300)
  test:
    start: 251
    end: 300
    description: "Unit tests and integration tests"

  # Demo/example code (301-350)
  demo:
    start: 301
    end: 350
    description: "Demo applications and examples"

  # Reserved for future use (351-400)
  # middleware:
  #   start: 351
  #   end: 400
  #   description: "Middleware components"

  # Reserved for future use (401-500)
  # platform:
  #   start: 401
  #   end: 500
  #   description: "Platform abstraction layer"

# Notes:
# - Currently allocated: 350 IDs across 5 modules
# - Available for expansion: 3745 IDs (351-4095)
# - Recommended: Pre-allocate ranges before starting development
# - Migration: If a module outgrows its range, allocate a new range
#   and update this config (old IDs remain valid for backward compatibility)
